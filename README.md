# TODO_LIST_Practice
A practice after finished the basic Go language

Be careful, this is just a practice project, not a real project.
And the most important is :
the frontView is only to test the connection
it's not a real front-end view
I haven't match the back-end with the front-end yet
Maybe the front-end is also wrong for my pool front-end skill
